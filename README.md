# Chess_App
 Chess app made using Unity and C#.  This was created as a project to improve my coding skills over winter break.  Also, I plan to help others learn to code using this project.  I will make tutorials on how I made this app for the University of Minnesota's App Developers Club (and potentially YouTube as well).
